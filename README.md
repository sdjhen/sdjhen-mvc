# sdjhen-MVC

## Description

This project uses a custom built Model-View-Controller (MVC) software architecture design pattern as a framework for building PHP applications.

## Usage

This is the sdjhen-MVC PHP framework. To use this MVC framework, navigate to the public folder and amend the `RewriteBase` snippet with your own project filepath. This is located in the `.htaccess` file. DO NOT alter the `.htaccess` files found in other parts of the application; only the one found in the public folder.
